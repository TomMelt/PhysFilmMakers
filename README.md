Phys FilmMakers
==============

Outreach Project with local school

`display.py` - program to display the current, voltage and power in the circuit.

`sound.py` - program to output a specific frequency sound based on a voltage reading.

`measure.py` - program returns current (mA), voltage (V) and power (mW) using the INA219 breakout board.

`pong.py` - a fun game which uses the measured current to move the players cursor.

Project Plan
============

## Carbon Allotropes
- graphite
- diamond
- amorphous
- other?

## Graphite
- structure and properties

## Electrical Circuits (recap)
- V = IR
- P = IV
- &rho; = RA/l
- &sigma; = 1/&rho; 
- Conductivity

## Draw Circuit
- LED
- Buzzer

## Measure Properties

## Make Predictions

## Explore Variable Resistors
- pressure sensors
- microphones?
- game controllers?
